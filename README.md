# portfolio

Follow the link to see my portfolio: https://jackieczhou.github.io/portfolio/.

This app contains a variety of projects within my github as well as pages about myself, a contact page and links to my resume and linkedin.

Features I was excited to try out were a typing feature on the contact page and a hobbies list that toggles automatically between each hobby on the about me page.

Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Layout & Design: Bootstrap

The next steps of this project would be: Fine tune styling. Convert entire project to React.js. Host on a live website. Add an "about me" video feautre. Add a contact feature to email me directly or setup an appointment via google calendar. Fix & add media queries for smoother screen size transition.
